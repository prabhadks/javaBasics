1. If Statements
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a given condition is true.
2. If-Else Statement
The else block is used if the condition is false. The code in the else block will execute when the condition is false.
3. Else-If Ladder
If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use an else-if ladder to handle multiple conditions.
4. Switch Statement
A switch statement is used to test a variable against multiple values. Itâ€™s often more readable than using multiple if-else statements when dealing with multiple conditions for the same variable.
Key Notes:
break; is used to exit the switch statement after a case is executed. Without it, the program will "fall through" to the next case.

The default case is optional but good practice; it handles any cases that don't match any of
